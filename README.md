# ip-calc
## My own python IP Subnet Calculator
### This simple web app has 3 functions:
- Show you the details of an IP address (is it a loopback, private, etc.)
- Show you the details of a network based on a network IP and prefix
- Show you the details of a subnet based on any given IP with prefix

The output is then given directly below the input box
